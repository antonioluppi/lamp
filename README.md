# lamp

This is an Arduino program to control a RGB Led lamp, and it's part of a capstone project for a degree in Product Design.
The light changes as time passes by, and for demonstration purpuses, changes its behavior based on user input through a capacitive sensor. 

I'm still developing it, so there's more stuff coming by.
